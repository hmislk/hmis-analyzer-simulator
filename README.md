An Analyzer Simulator for the Open-Source Hospital Management System Initiated by Dr M H B Ariyaratne

Title

An Analyzer Simulator for the Open Source Hospital Management Information System

Description

This is a simulator for analyzers that can be used to test the middleware when the real analyzers is not available. It communicates through com ports with the middleware.

History

Dr M H B Ariyaratne is a medical doctor who developed an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) System for his general practice in 2004 using Microsoft Visual Basic 6 and MS-Access. Doctors who have seen this EMR requested him to give the system for them to use. AS more doctors used the EMR, their requirements were discussed and incorporated into the system systematically. Some of the doctors who were using the EMR were having clinical laboratories, medical channelling centres and hospitals. Then the system was added new modules to cover new requirements. In 2012, a new JavaEE based system was initiated as an Open Source Initiative hosted in GitHub under the MIT license. The students of Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technical Education at Labuduwa, Galle, were allocated during their training for The Higher National Diploma in Information Technology (HNDIT) programme facilitated by Mr Mr.K.M.G.T.R. Waidyarathne, a lecturer from the Department Of Information Technology. Some of the students continued to support the project after their graduation under financial support by Dr M H B Ariyaratne. Commercial support was made available for installations, user training, maintenance, cloud hosting and troubleshooting.
